# Problem identify which of my cats is in the room with ML/Computer Vision

# Figure out which network/architecture we want to use
# potentially detecting multiple cats at once? mobile detect focused networks instead of classificaiton

# Pretrained model? 
# training data -> pictures of my cats with boundings boxes labeled 
# use the nvidia camera-collect tool to easily acquire/label data



# Imagine we have trained our model
# load the model
# set up our video inputs/outputs
# loop
#     get latest video feed as an image
#     process the image with our detection network
#     if the cat is Purrnest:
#         do X
#     if the cat is Kiki:
#         do Y
#     if the cat is Haru:
#         do Z



#     if image contains delivery person and package:
#         say thanks to delivery person
#     if image contains package and random person:
#         say get off my property1
#     if :
#         do Z
